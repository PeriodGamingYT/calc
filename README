i made this calculator because i felt unsatisified with my old one.
this is mainly made for my personal needs, i want to have a basic, easy to use calculator
in my terminal ready on demand.

so, i built one, but i also didn't want to use my old codebase as i feel the quality of that
and the design decisions are ones i would not make today.

it's a basic evaluator, parenthesis and uniary operations are prioritized above every binary 
expressions, which means that it will go left to right no matter what for binary expressions,
beware!

anyway, i try to avoid having to rely on order of operations in my code to make it clear how i 
want my math to work for everyone.

if this helps you, then suit yourself!
